### Selenium
Selenium is a Javsscript game framework built for creating isometric pixelart games in the browser. It was built expressly for the [Khaal](https://github.com/sephelim/khaal) RTS game, and as such has many elements that help specifically with RTS/city builder game development.

---

#### Usage
Selenium is built to be a braindead-framework. All the WebGL (beyond complex shaders) is abstracted away, and in its place easy-to-understand interfaces remain. All you need to properly use the framework is a configured project and a copy of Selenium. For setup details, check out [the wiki](https://github.com/sephelim/selenium/wiki).
